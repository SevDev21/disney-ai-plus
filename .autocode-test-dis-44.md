# Autocode Test Run - DIS-44

**Issue**: DIS-44 - Create new github branch title "This is a test branch with autocode"

**Date**: 2025-12-01

**Description**: This file documents a successful test run of the autocode workflow integration with Linear.

## Test Results

✅ Feature branch created: `autocode/dis-44-create-new-gihub-branch-title-this-is-a-`
✅ Autocode agent successfully processed Linear webhook
✅ Branch naming convention followed: `autocode/{issue-key}-{slugified-title}`

## Workflow Verification

This test confirms that:
- Linear webhook integration is functioning
- Autocode agent can parse issue metadata (key, title, labels)
- Git branch operations execute correctly
- The agent follows project constraints (no direct commits to master)

## Next Steps

This test issue demonstrates the autocode workflow is operational. Future issues with the "autocode" label will trigger automated branch creation and implementation.
