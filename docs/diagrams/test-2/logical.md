## Requirements

- This diagram defines the primary elements and relationships for Logical View, and implementation must ensure that all shown components, connections, and responsibilities are realized in code, configuration, and infrastructure.
- The development team shall treat each visual element as either a deployable artifact, a runtime capability, or an integration point, and create tasks to build, configure, and test each of them.
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, observability, resilience) must be applied to all links and components shown in the diagram.
